# 🧩 Killer Sudoku Helper

Hey there! 👋 This is a fun little tool I made to help solve [Killer Sudoku](https://sudoku.com/killer) puzzles. You know, those tricky ones with extra cage rules!

I built this while playing around with some AI tools for web dev - pretty cool stuff!

## 🛠️ How I Put This Together

1. Started with a fresh Vue project (`pnpm create vue@latest .`)
2. Added Pug and Sass for nicer code (`pnpm install pug sass-embedded`)
3. Cleaned out all the template stuff
4. Had a nice chat with Cursor AI to help build the actual app
5. Got a cute icon from recraft.ai (told it "make me a sudoku solver icon, but keep it tiny!")
6. Did some icon cleanup in GIMP to make it look just right

## 📝 About the Code

Most of this was created with AI tools, so I'm honestly not sure about the licensing situation. If you want to use any of it, maybe double-check that part! 😅

## Last Message From Human

Even the README was written by AI now. I only wrote python code for the solver and the git commit messages.
